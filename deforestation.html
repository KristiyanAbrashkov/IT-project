        <p id="info">Every hour, forests equivalent to 300 football fields vanish. By 2030, Earth may retain only 10% of its forests; unchecked deforestation could wipe them out in under a century.

            Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Indonesia top the list for deforestation. The Amazon, spanning 6.9 million square kilometers (2.72 million square miles), harbors 40% of South America's landmass and sustains three million species. Despite conservation efforts, legal deforestation persists, with Brazil's Amazon losing 1.5 million hectares yearly, a third of global tropical deforestation.
            
            Agriculture drives deforestation, notably for livestock and lucrative crops like sugar cane and palm oil. Beyond carbon storage, forests prevent soil erosion by anchoring soil with tree roots, curbing landslides. Yet, this vital ecosystem service faces peril due to rampant logging. Protecting forests is critical not only for biodiversity but also for sustaining ecosystems and mitigating climate change. Efforts to curb deforestation must intensify to safeguard Earth's forests for future generations..</p>
