    <h1>What is an environmental problem?</h1>
    <h2>An environmental problem is any negative impact on the natural environment caused by human activities or natural processes. These problems can affect ecosystems, biodiversity, human health, and the planet's ability to sustain life. Common environmental problems include pollution (air, water, soil), deforestation, climate change, loss of biodiversity, and depletion of natural resources. Addressing these issues often requires coordinated efforts to implement sustainable practices, reduce harmful emissions, and preserve natural habitats.</h2>
