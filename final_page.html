        <li class="lists">Volunteer. Volunteer for cleanups in your community. You can get involved in protecting your watershed, too.</li>
        <li class="lists">Educate. When you further your own education, you can help others understand the importance and value of our natural resources.</li>
        <li class="lists">Conserve water. The less water you use, the less runoff and wastewater that eventually end up in the ocean.</li>
